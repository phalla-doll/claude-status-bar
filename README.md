## Claude Status Bar

A tiny macOS menu bar app that shows **Claude Code's live status**: an animated Claude icon while it's thinking or running a tool, a yellow dot when it's awaiting your permission, and the elapsed time of the current turn. Lightweight, no window, no dock icon, no usage dashboards.

> Built so you can tab away during a long "thinking" stretch and still see, at a glance, whether Claude is working, waiting on you, or done.

## What it shows

- **Thinking / working** — the icon animates, with a live `1m 1s` timer.
- **Running a tool** — a short label (`Editing`, `Reading`, `Running command`, `Using tool`, …).
- **Awaiting permission** — a paused yellow dot, in both the CLI and the Desktop app.
- **Idle / done** — rests on the Claude logo.

Everything is controlled from the menu:

- **Show timer:** toggle the elapsed `1m 1s` clock.
- **Thinking words:** rotate a playful verb (`Manifesting…`, `Percolating…`) in place of `Thinking…`, like Claude Code (on by default).
- **Animation style:**
  - **Claude Spark**, the web/chat "morph" spark
  - **Claude Code**, the terminal glyph spinner
  - **Crab Walking**, a pixel-art Clawd crab that scuttles while Claude works
- **Icon color:** **Orange** or **System** (adaptive black/white). All three styles follow this setting: in System mode Crab Walking renders as a shaded monochrome silhouette that matches the menu bar.
- **Version and update:** the menu shows your current version, with a one-click "Update available" when a newer release exists.

**Multi-session support.** When several Claude Code sessions run at once (multiple terminals, or a terminal plus the desktop app), the menu bar surfaces the highest-priority one: a session awaiting your permission is never hidden behind one that's thinking. The dropdown lists every live session. Precise per-tab focus is in progress: **[issue #19 →](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/19)**.

## Where it works

| Surface | Tracked? |
|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI (terminal) | ✅ |
| Claude Code Desktop — **Code** tab | ✅ |
| Cursor (Claude Code extension) | ✅ |
| Claude Desktop — **Chat/Cowork** tab | ❌ |

## Install

### DMG

Signed and notarized.

1. Download the latest `ClaudeStatusBar.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Open it and drag **Claude Status Bar** into Applications.
3. Launch it once. On first launch it wires up the Claude Code hooks for you automatically.
4. Start a new Claude Code session, the icon appears whenever Claude Code is running.

> **Official `brew install` coming soon.**

### Updating

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Updated mid-session?** Sessions already open won't show up until they do something (send a prompt) or you start a new `claude` session.

Download the latest DMG and drag it into Applications (choose **Replace**). That's it: it refreshes its own hooks the next time it starts up (on a version change it re-runs its installer automatically), so there's nothing to run by hand. Your next Claude Code session picks them up.

## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI or the Desktop app)
- Node.js

## How it works

The app is stateless. Claude Code fires hooks as it works; the app polls those updates and aggregates them across every live session into a single icon, a permission dot if one needs you, animating if any session is working, resting when all are idle. It launches itself when Claude Code opens and quits when nothing's running, so there's nothing to manage.

The installer merges its hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` (backing it up first), and the app's only network call is a once-a-day GitHub release check ([details](PRIVACY.md)).

## Multiple accounts

Run a second Claude Code account through `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (a common setup)?

```sh
# ~/.zshrc
claude2() { CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-2" claude "$@"; }
```

By default the app only wires hooks into the primary `~/.claude`, so `claude2` sessions never show up. Wire the second account once — pointing `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at it — and its sessions join the same status bar:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-2" node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/install.js"
```

That's it. The scripts and session state stay in the shared `~/.claude/statusbar/` hub, so a single app still shows everything. When two or more accounts are live, each row gets an account badge next to its `CLI`/`APP` pill (`[claude-2][CLI]`); with one account the rows look exactly as before. The badge defaults to the config dir's name — set `CLAUDE_STATUSBAR_ACCOUNT` in that account's shell to label it something friendlier.

## Troubleshooting

Icon quitting right after you open it, not showing, or not moving in Cursor? See [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md), most of it is expected behavior, not a bug.

## Uninstall

```bash
node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.js"   # removes only our hooks
```
Then drag the app to the Trash. Wired up a [second account](#multiple-accounts)? Clean it the same way, pointing at its config dir:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-2" node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.js"
```

## Acknowledgements

I built this for myself, then open-sourced it because other people might find it handy too, and I'm genuinely thrilled that so many of you do. An extra thank-you to everyone who went the extra mile and contributed code, fixes, and ideas.
