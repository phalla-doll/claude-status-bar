# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. This is a tiny menu bar app and I'd like to keep it that way.

It does one thing: show Claude Code's live status. It stays local (the only network call is a daily update check), free (no API key, no spend), and small (a status bar, not a dashboard).

It's also inspired a bunch of forks and ports, Codex versions, Linux, Windows, other agents, and I love seeing that. If your idea is one of those, it almost certainly belongs in your own fork, not here. This app is Claude Code on macOS, and I want to keep it that.

## What's welcome

Bug fixes, performance wins, animation and visual polish, better session focus, and compatibility fixes (macOS versions, CPU architectures, terminals).

Also the [known issues and suggestions](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/22): it tracks proposed enhancements, and anything marked in scope there is open to pick up.

## Won't be merged

- Sending your conversation, files, or project to any API or relay.
- Anything that costs money or needs an API key.
- Usage meters, cost dashboards, analytics, or telemetry.
- Heavy work in the hooks. They run on every event, so they write one small state file and exit: no network, no per-prompt API calls.
- Hardcoding for one locale, provider, relay, or terminal.
- New settings stores or dependencies for a minor feature when what's already there works.
- Changing how your machine behaves: preventing sleep, holding power assertions, running privileged helpers, or any background action beyond showing status. The app displays state, it doesn't act on your system.
- Codex support, ports to Linux or Windows, or support for other agents. Great projects, but as your own fork. This one is Claude Code on macOS.

## Building

You'll need macOS 12+, the Swift toolchain (Xcode Command Line Tools), and Node.js (the hooks run on Node).

```bash
./build.sh          # -> build/ClaudeStatusBar.app
./build.sh --dmg    # also builds a .dmg
```

Signing and notarization use the maintainer's Developer ID; without it you get an ad-hoc build, which is fine for testing. Launch it, start a Claude Code session, and the icon appears.

Build off the latest `main` so you're not fixing something that already changed.

## Testing

Before you open a PR, actually run it. "Builds clean" is not testing.

Test it on both surfaces, because they behave differently:

- the **Claude desktop app**, and
- the **CLI, in a terminal**.

And tell me which terminal you used (Terminal.app, Ghostty, iTerm2, WezTerm, and so on). Behavior genuinely differs between them, so "works for me" without naming the terminal doesn't tell me much. For any visual or timing change, attach a screenshot or a short screen recording.

## AI-assisted contributions

AI tools are welcome, I use them too. But you own the code you submit: review every line, be able to explain why it's correct, and remove AI attribution footers (the `🤖 Generated with…` lines). A PR that's an unreviewed AI dump you can't defend will be closed, however tidy it looks.

## What to expect

This is a solo hobby project. Replies can be slow, and I may decline a perfectly good PR because it adds complexity or scope I don't want to carry. That's not a knock on your work. When in doubt keep the change small, and check the [known issues](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/22) first: some behavior that looks like a bug is intentional and already understood, timing, lifecycle, and self-quit especially.
